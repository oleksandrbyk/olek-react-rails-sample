## ES6 Foo

We are using [ES6](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) in the examples. Following are some of the resources, that I will recommend reading before the workshop.

*They are not mandatory to read, but if you have read them, it will be easier to understand some of the usage of ES6.*

Note: Our usage of ES6 is very limited so even if you don't know anything about ES6, it is fine üòÅ
