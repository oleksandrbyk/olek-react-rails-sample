Expert intuition: The situation has provided a cue; this cue has given the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer. Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition.

Valid intuitions develop when experts have learned to recognize familiar elements in a new situation and to act in a manner that is appropriate to it.

Philip Tetlock's book "Expert Political Judgment: How Good Is It? How Can We Know?" - gathered more than 80,000 predictions. The experts performed worse than they would have if they had simply assigned equal probabilities. Even in the region they knew best, experts were not significantly better than nonspecialists.

People who spend their time, and earn their living, studying a particular topic produce poorer predictions than dart-throwing monkeys.

Those with the most knowledge are often less reliable. The reason is that the person who acquires more knowledge develops an enhanced illusion of her skill and becomes unrealistically overconfident.

Hedgehogs “know one big thing” and have a theory about the world; they account for particular events within a coherent framework, bristle with impatience toward those who don’t see things their way, and are confident in their forecasts. They are also especially reluctant to admit error.

It is much easier to strive for perfection when you are never bored.
